## Project overview
**(Overview)**
This project focuses on redesigning key screens in the My WE mobile application to improve usability, clarity, and user control, while addressing real user problems in package management and support

**(Problem Statement)**
The original application suffered from poor screen space utilization, repetitive information, unclear package renewal flows, limited support access, and the inability to complete critical tasks without an internet connection.

**(Objectives)**

▪️Improve visual hierarchy and clarity

▪️Reduce redundancy and cognitive load

▪️Increase user control over package renewal and upgrades

▪️Provide fast and accessible support in critical scenarios


**(Scope)**

The redesign covers four main screens:

▪️Home Page

▪️Package Renewal & Upgrade Page

▪️AI Chatbot Support Page

▪️No Internet Access Page


**(Approach & Solution)**
The redesign applies HCI principles to simplify user flows, highlight key actions, integrate AI-powered support, and provide actionable solutions when internet access is unavailable.


**(Impact)**
The redesigned experience reduces user frustration, enables faster decision-making, improves support accessibility, and delivers a more user-centered and reliable application.
